A user may declare their persistent self to the block. This is not required for participation in Concord messaging.
Doing so requires submitting an unencrypted block of this form:
Declarant trip should be used as server trip.
{
    "d": declarant trip code (for validation),
    "pubk": declarant DSA public key,
    "sig": hexstr signature for the declaration message,
    (required for DMs) "rsa_pubk": declarant RSA public key,
    (optional) "n": declarant user name,
    (optional) "imgli": declarant profile image link
}
Alternatively, for server-specific identification, a user may make a declaration specifically to a server.

Once a user declares themself thusly, their trip code can be considered as a server without membership.
That is, all normal procedures for a server apply, except:
 - RSA is used instead of asymmetric encryption so that only they can receive messages.
 - Any pubkey is allowed, though client-side filtration may be applied.
