Blockhain:
A Concord blockchain is designed to represent a full decentralized messaging service. It's likely that the Concord
ecosystem will revolve around one large chain. Like any blockchain, the Concord chain's core features
decentralization and order immutability.
Each block has six elements: the date, the previous block's hash, the current block's hash, the current block's nonce, the nonce contributor's tripcode, the current block's target tripcode, and the current block's contents.
They adhere to the following formats:
Date (22 chars): [year]-[month]-[day]T[hour]-[minute]-[second]GMT
GMT is the Concord standard.
Previous block's hash (64 chars): hexstr of SHA256 cut to 32 bytes for previous block.
Current block's hash (64 chars): hexstr of SHA256 cut to 32 bytes for current block.
Current block's nonce (32 chars): hexstr of 16-byte nonce
Nonce contributor's tripcode (32 chars): hexstr of 16-byte tripcode.
Current block's target tripcode (32 chars): hexstr of 16-byte tripcode.
Current block's contents (arbitrary chars): any string.
Within a particular block, there are hence 22 + 64 + 64 + 32 + 32 + 32 = 246 chars of non-content data.
Since only content has variable length, any block can be easily split into its components.
For proof of work, the '0' character is required some n times in the hash hexstr. A Concord chain may have any
POW threshold.
So that POW is known and independent chains can be maintained, the first block in a chain should have the following json content:
{
    "n": chain name,
    "c": chain tripcode,
    "p": POW threshold
}
Being as such a block has no predecessor, it should also use 64 '0' characters in place of the previous block's hash.
